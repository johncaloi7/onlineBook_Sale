How to use this simple repo online payment app using Stripe.

-Clone this repo to your machine.

-Next thing is to use "npm install" using your Git Bash(for Windows User) or Terminal
 for Mac and Linux users.
 
-"node app.js" to run this in app in your browser.
 
 
 NOTE! 
 You may use nodemon here just replace in the package.json file the 
 "start": "node app.js" into "start": "nodemon app.js"
 
 I changed it back to node since I had an issue deploying it to heroku, but it's all
 up you guys which one would run perfectly for you.
 
 
 
 THANKS! :)
